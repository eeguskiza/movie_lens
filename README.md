# 🎬 MovieLens Recommender System
This repository contains a deep learning-based movie recommendation system built with PyTorch using the [MovieLens 100K dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). The goal is to explore various neural architectures for collaborative filtering using embeddings, and evaluate their performance through different training strategies.
